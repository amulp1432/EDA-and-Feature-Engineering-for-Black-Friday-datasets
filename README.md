# Problem Statement
A retail company “ABC Private Limited” wants to understand the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month. The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, city_type, stay_in_current_city), product details (product_id and product category) and Total purchase_amount from last month.

Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products.

In this datasets, I have done different feature engineering.
firstly, I have checked all the datatype of the feature.
filling all the missing value by imputation technique
Handling categorical feature Gender
Replacing the column feature of Gender feature by 0 and 1 for male and female.
Replacing all the Age features by integer value
